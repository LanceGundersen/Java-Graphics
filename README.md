# Java-Graphics

Project One is simple in nature and displays a series of simple 2D images and uses Java 2D graphic methods to rotate, scale and translate each of the images.
- Translate -5 in x direction, Translate +7 in the y direction. 
- Rotate 45 counter clockwise. 
- Rotate 90 clockwise 
- Scale 2 times for the x component, scale 0.5 times for the y component 
- Each of these transformations should be displayed in sequence with the images always starting from the previous transformation as opposed to the original image. 
- Use Java 2D graphics to display each transformation for each image.

## What I Learned

- The conversion process to create the images in the first place is not so straightforward.
- This is extremely tedious and I feel for the people before me that paved the path forward. I did however find it interesting to manipulate the images.
